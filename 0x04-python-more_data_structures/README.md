# *More Data Structures* :joy:

**In this repository we are going into more data structures and operations on them such as :**
- 
- ## Lambda, filter, reduce and map
- ## Learn to Program 12 Lambda Map 

- ## Filter Reduce

### **0. Squared simple**

> Write a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix.
1. matrix is a 2 dimensional array
2. Returns a new matrix:
3. Same size as matrix
4. Each value should be the square of the value of the input
5. Initial matrix should not be modified
6. You are not allowed to import any module
7. You are allowed to use regular loops, map, etc.

### **1. Search and replace**

> Write a function that replaces all occurrences of an element by another in a new list.

1. Prototype: def search_replace(my_list, search, replace):
2. my_list is the initial list
3. search is the element to replace in the list
4. replace is the new element
5. You are not allowed to import any module

### **2. Unique addition**

> Write a function that adds all unique integers in a list (only once for each integer).

1. Prototype: def uniq_add(my_list=[]):
2. You are not allowed to import any module

# *More Data Structures* :joy:

**In this repository we are going into more data structures and operations on them such as :**
- 
- ## Lambda, filter, reduce and map
- ## Learn to Program 12 Lambda Map 

- ## Filter Reduce

### **0. Squared simple**

> Write a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix.
1. matrix is a 2 dimensional array
2. Returns a new matrix:
3. Same size as matrix
4. Each value should be the square of the value of the input
5. Initial matrix should not be modified
6. You are not allowed to import any module
7. You are allowed to use regular loops, map, etc.

### **1. Search and replace**

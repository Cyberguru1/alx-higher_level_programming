# *More Data Structures* :joy:

**In this repository we are going into more data structures and operations on them such as :**
- 
- ## Lambda, filter, reduce and map
- ## Learn to Program 12 Lambda Map 

- ## Filter Reduce

### **0. Squared simple**

> Write a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix.
- matrix is a 2 dimensional array
- Returns a new matrix:
- Same size as matrix
- Each value should be the square of the value of the input
- Initial matrix should not be modified
- You are not allowed to import any module
- You are allowed to use regular loops, map, etc.
